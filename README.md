# Distributed-Collaborative-Key-Agreement-for-Dynamic-Peer-Groups
        The goal of group key management is to set up and maintain a shared secret key among the group members. It serves as a cornerstone for other DPG security services.
        The existing system involves centralized key server in which all the systems depend on centralized server for key generations. The proposed distributive nature of the system, avoids the usage of a centralized key server for key generations.
